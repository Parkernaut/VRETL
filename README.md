# VRETL
VR application allowing for ETL solutions within an intuitive cyberspace. 

## Why?

+ I am a Data Engineer who loves Virtual Reality with my entire being. VR today only scrapes the tip of the iceberg for its true potential, including its more useful interactions within the industry.
+ This is mainly a fun side project to unite both my profession during the day and my hobby at night into one application I could see myself using within the next ten years.
